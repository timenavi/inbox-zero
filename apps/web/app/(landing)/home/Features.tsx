      All the benefits of a personal assistant, at a fraction of the cost. It

      <br />
      <br />
      Tell your AI assistant how to manage your email in plain English - just
      like you would ChatGPT. Want newsletters archived and labeled? Investor
      emails flagged as important? Automatic reply drafts for common requests?
      Just ask.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once configured, your assistant works 24/7 to keep your inbox organized
      exactly how you want it. No more drowning in email. No expensive human
      assistant required.
